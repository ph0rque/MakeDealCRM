### ⚠️ Feature 3: Checklist Due-Diligence
**Status:** MODULE NOT AVAILABLE  
**Critical Functionality:** REQUIRES SETUP

#### Test Results:
- ❌ Checklist templates module - NOT FOUND
- ❌ Checklist page objects - TIMEOUT ERRORS
- ❌ Template creation workflow - MODULE MISSING

#### Key Findings:
- **Module dependency:** Checklist functionality appears to be a custom module
- **Page object errors:** `.templates-list-view` selector not found
- **Navigation issues:** Checklist module URLs not accessible

#### Recommendations:
1. Verify checklist module installation and configuration
2. Check custom module dependencies
3. Update page object selectors for checklist UI
4. Consider if checklist is implemented as subpanel instead of separate module

---

### ⚠️ Feature 4: Stakeholder Tracking
**Status:** CORE FUNCTIONALITY WORKING, PAGE OBJECTS NEED UPDATE  
**Critical Functionality:** PARTIAL

#### Test Results:
- ❌ Page object navigation - TIMEOUT ERRORS
- ⚠️ Contact creation workflow - ACCESSIBLE VIA ALTERNATIVE ROUTES
- ⚠️ Role assignment - REQUIRES UI SELECTOR UPDATES

#### Key Findings:
- **List view selector issues:** `.list-view-rounded-corners` not found
- **Contact functionality exists:** Can access via direct navigation
- **Role assignment UI present:** Forms available but selectors need updating

#### Issues Identified:
1. Page object selectors outdated for current SuiteCRM UI
2. Navigation helper methods need modern selector patterns
3. Role assignment fields may use different naming conventions

---

### ⚠️ Feature 5: Financial Hub & Valuation
**Status:** CONFIGURATION ISSUES  
**Critical Functionality:** REQUIRES SETUP

#### Test Results:
- ❌ Financial hub widget accessibility - CONFIGURATION ERROR
- ❌ What-if calculator integration - PAGE OBJECT ISSUES
- ❌ Financial calculation helpers - AUTH CONTEXT ERROR
- ✅ Financial calculation logic - WORKING (mathematical functions)

#### Key Findings:
- **Auth helper misconfiguration:** `testData` context not properly initialized
- **Page object navigation issues:** Similar to other features
- **Financial logic sound:** Mathematical calculations working correctly
- **UI elements missing:** Financial hub widgets not found with current selectors

#### Issues Identified:
1. Authentication helper expects test data context that's not available
2. Financial hub UI may be implemented differently than expected
3. Page object selectors need updating for financial widgets
4. Calculator modal/widget detection requires different approach

#### Recommendations:
1. Fix authentication helper to work without test data context
2. Investigate actual financial hub UI implementation
3. Update page objects with correct financial widget selectors
4. Consider if financial features are integrated into deal forms rather than separate widgets

**Solution Implemented:**
- Increased timeouts to 120s for complex operations
- Added progressive wait strategies
- Implemented fallback navigation methods

### 2. UI Selector Outdated
**Root Cause:** SuiteCRM UI updates since test creation
**Impact:** Page object navigation failures
**Solution Implemented:**
- Added multiple selector fallbacks
- Implemented modern CSS selector patterns
- Created flexible element detection logic

### 3. Module Dependencies
**Root Cause:** Custom modules may not be installed/configured
**Impact:** Checklist functionality completely unavailable
**Solution Required:**
- Verify custom module installation
- Check module configuration
- Update module URLs and navigation paths

### 4. Test Data Management
**Root Cause:** Tests creating persistent data without cleanup
**Impact:** Test isolation issues
**Solution Implemented:**
- Added unique test identifiers (timestamps)
- Implemented cleanup test procedures
- Created data isolation strategies

## Performance Metrics

### Test Execution Times:
- **Simple tests:** 15-30 seconds
- **Complex workflows:** 60-120 seconds
- **Pipeline tests:** < 15 seconds (excellent performance)
- **Module navigation:** 5-10 seconds

### System Performance:
- **Application load time:** < 2 seconds
- **Deal creation:** 3-5 seconds
- **Pipeline rendering:** < 5 seconds
- **Authentication:** < 1 second

### Resource Usage:
- **Memory usage:** Normal (within expected ranges)
- **Network requests:** Efficient (minimal unnecessary calls)

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Test Structure Improvements
```javascript
// Before: Monolithic test with single failure point
test('Complex E2E workflow', async ({ page }) => {
  // 200+ lines of sequential operations
});

// After: Modular tests with progressive complexity
test('Basic deal creation', async ({ page }) => {
  // Core functionality only
});

test('Deal with contacts', async ({ page }) => {
  // Builds on basic functionality
});
```

### 2. Selector Resilience
```javascript
// Before: Single selector
await page.click('.specific-button');

// After: Multiple fallback selectors
const button = await page.locator(
  'input[value="Save"]:visible, ' +
  'button:has-text("Save"):visible, ' +
  '#SAVE'
).first();
```

### 3. Wait Strategy Improvements
```javascript
// Before: Fixed timeouts
await page.waitForTimeout(2000);

// After: Dynamic waiting
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle');
await page.waitForSelector('.indicator:visible');
```
