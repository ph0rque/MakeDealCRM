			"reasoning": "High complexity due to real-time financial calculations, multiple interconnected components, and the need for accuracy in financial computations. Requires careful attention to performance and data synchronization."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance Email Integration and Auto-Processing",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: email parsing algorithm improvements, fuzzy matching implementation for duplicates, contact extraction using NLP/regex patterns, attachment processing pipeline, deal context recognition engine, email thread tracking system, conversation history data model, error handling and retry mechanisms, and performance optimization for bulk email processing.",
			"reasoning": "Complex due to parsing unstructured data, implementing intelligent matching algorithms, and handling various email formats and attachments. Requires robust error handling and scalability considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Advanced Search and Filtering System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for: search index architecture design, query parser implementation, multi-criteria filter engine, saved search functionality, debounced search with auto-complete, quick filter components, search result export system, mobile search UI optimization, and search performance optimization with caching strategies.",
			"reasoning": "Significant complexity in building a performant search system that handles multiple criteria, provides real-time suggestions, and scales well with large datasets while maintaining mobile usability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Build Chrome Extension for Deal Capture",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize subtasks around: Chrome extension manifest and structure setup, content script development for data extraction, background script for API communication, SuiteCRM API endpoint creation, data extraction rules for popular listing sites, extension UI/UX design, duplicate detection integration, options page for configuration, and extension security implementation.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate to high complexity due to cross-platform development (extension + CRM), security considerations, and the need to extract data from various website structures reliably."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
