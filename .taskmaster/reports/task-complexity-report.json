		{
			"taskId": 12,
			"taskTitle": "Audit Top-Level Modules Directory Structure",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the audit process into systematic phases: initial file discovery and cataloging, file purpose analysis through code examination, SuiteCRM convention mapping, documentation of findings, creation of migration matrix, validation of audit completeness, generation of migration plan, and final review/approval process.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to need for thorough code analysis, understanding of SuiteCRM conventions, and creation of comprehensive migration documentation. Requires multiple phases to ensure no files are missed and all dependencies are properly mapped."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Relocate Code from Top-Level Modules to Proper SuiteCRM Structure",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the relocation process into careful stages: preparation and backup, file categorization by destination, Git history preservation setup, batch file movement operations, path reference updates in moved files, namespace and autoload adjustments, permission preservation, validation of moves, rollback procedure preparation, and final cleanup tasks.",
			"reasoning": "Very high complexity due to potential for breaking changes, need to preserve Git history, multiple file types and destinations, and requirement to update all internal references. Risk of system breakage requires careful staged approach."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Update All Code References to Reflect New File Paths",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize the reference update process by file type and reference pattern: PHP require/include statements, autoloader configurations, JavaScript AJAX endpoints, configuration files, .htaccess rules, route definitions, template file references, cron job scripts, deployment scripts, documentation references, unit test paths, and final validation sweep.",
			"reasoning": "Highest complexity due to the wide variety of reference types across different languages and configurations. Missing even a single reference could cause runtime errors. Requires systematic approach covering all possible reference patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Remove Empty Top-Level Modules Directory",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Simple cleanup process: verify directory is completely empty including hidden files, check for any remaining symlinks or special files, safely remove the directory, and update any documentation that mentions the old structure.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity as it's primarily a cleanup task, but still requires careful verification to ensure nothing important is deleted and no references remain."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Locate Missing Pipeline CSS and JavaScript Files",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Systematic search approach: comprehensive filename search across entire codebase, content-based search for pipeline/kanban functionality, Git history investigation for deleted/moved files, vendor/third-party library checks, backup/archive examination, and documentation of all findings with recommendations.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity as it's primarily a search operation, but requires thorough investigation including Git history and understanding of where such files might be located in a SuiteCRM project."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Recreate Missing Pipeline Assets if Not Found",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Recreate assets with modern standards: analyze view.pipeline.php requirements, design CSS architecture for kanban board layout, implement drag-and-drop JavaScript functionality, create AJAX handlers for backend communication, add visual feedback and animations, ensure mobile responsiveness, implement error handling, add accessibility features, and create documentation for the new assets.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to need to reverse-engineer requirements from existing code, implement modern drag-and-drop functionality, ensure SuiteCRM compatibility, and create production-ready assets from scratch."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Fix Pipeline View File References",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Update file references systematically: locate all asset references in view.pipeline.php, determine correct SuiteCRM asset path conventions, update paths to match located/recreated files, and verify proper loading in different contexts (direct access, AJAX loads).",
			"reasoning": "Low to moderate complexity as it's primarily path updates, but requires understanding of SuiteCRM's asset loading conventions and testing in different contexts."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Test and Validate Pipeline Functionality",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Comprehensive testing phases: setup test data and scenarios, visual rendering tests across browsers, drag-and-drop functionality testing, AJAX communication validation, data persistence verification, responsive design testing, performance testing with multiple deals, and edge case/error condition testing.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate to high complexity due to the interactive nature of the feature, need for cross-browser testing, and variety of test scenarios required to ensure reliable functionality."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Audit Current Feature Implementation Status",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Systematic feature audit process: create feature checklist from documentation, search for database schema evidence, examine module files for feature code, check configuration and settings, test discovered functionality, document implementation percentage for each feature, and compile comprehensive status report with evidence.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate to high complexity due to need to understand multiple features, search across entire codebase, and accurately assess implementation status with supporting evidence."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Update Documentation to Reflect Actual Implementation Status",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Documentation update workflow: create accurate status labels for each feature, add detailed implementation notes for partial features, document all known issues and bugs, create technical debt inventory with prioritization, and establish ongoing documentation maintenance process.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity as it requires clear technical writing, accurate status assessment based on audit findings, and creation of actionable technical debt documentation."
