# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Automated Backup and Security Hardening
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up comprehensive backup system and enhance security measures for production deployment
# Details:
Implement automated encrypted S3 backups with configurable schedules. Set up database backup verification and restore testing. Enhance existing security measures with additional XSS protection, CSRF tokens, and input validation. Implement rate limiting and brute force protection. Add security headers and SSL/TLS configuration. Create backup monitoring and alert system for failed backups.
