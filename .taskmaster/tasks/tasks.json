Add support for conditional task generation based on deal characteristics.\n<info added on 2025-07-24T19:01:34.621Z>\nAuto-generation engine implementation started. Development approach consists of five core components: The TaskGenerationEngine class will serve as the main orchestration component, handling the overall generation process and coordinating between subsystems. TemplateParser module will handle dynamic variable substitution, supporting both simple replacements (e.g., {{dealName}}, {{buyerName}}) and complex conditional logic for template customization. SchedulingSystem will calculate task due dates based on deal timeline parameters, supporting both absolute and relative date calculations with business day awareness. DependencyManager will handle task relationships, ensuring proper ordering and prerequisite tracking for generated tasks. BulkTaskOperations will enable efficient batch processing for generating multiple tasks simultaneously, optimizing database operations and improving performance for large template instantiations.\n</info added on 2025-07-24T19:01:34.621Z>\n<info added on 2025-07-24T19:31:29.409Z>\nTask auto-generation engine implementation completed successfully.

TemplateParser supports advanced variable substitution with conditional logic capabilities for dynamic template customization. SchedulingSystem includes business day calculations, timezone handling, and flexible date scheduling options. DependencyManager features cycle detection algorithms and topological sorting for proper task ordering. BulkTaskOperations enables high-performance batch processing with optimized database operations. TaskGenerationApi provides complete REST endpoint coverage for all generation operations. Database schema implemented with full relational support for templates, tasks, and dependencies. Example template demonstrates all system capabilities including variable substitution, conditional generation, and dependency management.

Test AJAX functionality by monitoring network requests during pipeline loading. Verify drag-and-drop operations work correctly after the fix. Test fallback behavior if pipeline view fails to load. Check browser console for JavaScript errors during pipeline initialization. Validate that all pipeline data displays correctly including deal cards and stage columns. Test pipeline view across different browsers and devices for consistency."
