Development approach consists of five core components: The TaskGenerationEngine class will serve as the main orchestration component, handling the overall generation process and coordinating between subsystems. TemplateParser module will handle dynamic variable substitution, supporting both simple replacements (e.g., {{dealName}}, {{buyerName}}) and complex conditional logic for template customization. SchedulingSystem will calculate task due dates based on deal timeline parameters, supporting both absolute and relative date calculations with business day awareness. DependencyManager will handle task relationships, ensuring proper ordering and prerequisite tracking for generated tasks. BulkTaskOperations will enable efficient batch processing for generating multiple tasks simultaneously, optimizing database operations and improving performance for large template instantiations.
