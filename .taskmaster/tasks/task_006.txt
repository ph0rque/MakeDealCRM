# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Advanced Search and Filtering System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create powerful search capabilities with financial metric sorting and multi-criteria filtering
# Details:
Build advanced search interface allowing sorting by financial metrics (Revenue, EBITDA, Multiple, etc.). Implement multi-criteria filtering with saved search functionality. Add quick filters for pipeline stages, deal status, and stakeholder roles. Implement debounced search with auto-complete suggestions. Create export functionality for search results. Ensure mobile-optimized search interface.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for search algorithm accuracy, performance tests for large dataset searches, UI tests for filter combinations, mobile usability testing, search result export validation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Search Index Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational search index structure to support multi-criteria filtering and fast query performance across deal data
### Details:
Design database indexes for deal fields (revenue, EBITDA, multiple, stage, status). Implement full-text search indexes for deal names and descriptions. Create composite indexes for common filter combinations. Define search schema with proper field weighting and relevance scoring.

## 2. Implement Core Query Parser [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build the query parser that translates user search inputs into optimized database queries
### Details:
Create search query parser that handles text searches, numeric ranges, and boolean filters. Implement query sanitization and validation. Add support for advanced operators (AND, OR, NOT) and parenthetical grouping. Optimize query generation for performance.

## 3. Build Multi-Criteria Filter Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Develop the filtering system that allows users to apply multiple search criteria simultaneously
### Details:
Create filter components for financial metrics (revenue ranges, EBITDA thresholds, multiples). Implement pipeline stage filters and deal status selections. Add stakeholder role filtering. Build filter combination logic with real-time result updates.

## 4. Implement Saved Search Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Create system for users to save, name, and reuse complex search configurations
### Details:
Build saved search database schema and CRUD operations. Create UI for saving current search/filter state with custom names. Implement search sharing functionality between users. Add favorite searches and quick access shortcuts.

## 5. Develop Debounced Search with Auto-Complete [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement real-time search suggestions and auto-complete functionality with performance optimization
### Details:
Create debounced search input with 300ms delay to prevent excessive API calls. Implement auto-complete suggestions for deal names, companies, and contacts. Add search history and recent searches. Optimize suggestion queries for sub-100ms response times.

## 6. Create Quick Filter Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Build UI components for commonly used filters that provide one-click access to frequent searches
### Details:
Design quick filter buttons for pipeline stages (Lead, Qualified, LOI, Due Diligence, Closed). Create deal status quick filters (Active, Pending, Completed, Lost). Add financial range quick filters (sub-$1M, $1-5M, $5M+). Implement visual filter state indicators.

## 7. Build Search Result Export System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Implement functionality to export filtered search results in multiple formats
### Details:
Create export functionality for CSV, Excel, and PDF formats. Implement customizable column selection for exports. Add batch export capabilities for large result sets. Include export progress indicators and download management.

## 8. Optimize Mobile Search UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.5, 6.6
### Description: Create mobile-responsive search interface with touch-optimized controls and compact layouts
### Details:
Design mobile-first search interface with collapsible filter panels. Implement touch-friendly filter controls and swipe gestures. Create compact result cards optimized for mobile viewing. Add pull-to-refresh and infinite scroll for mobile search results.

## 9. Implement Search Performance Optimization and Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Add caching strategies and performance optimizations to ensure fast search response times
### Details:
Implement Redis caching for frequent search queries and results. Add database query optimization with proper indexing strategies. Create search result pagination with cursor-based navigation. Implement background search result pre-loading for common filters.
