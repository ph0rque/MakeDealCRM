# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Unified Deal & Portfolio Pipeline Architecture
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the visual Kanban-style pipeline system with 11 stages covering acquisition to post-close management
# Details:
The pipeline UI is mostly complete with drag-and-drop functionality, time tracking, and visual alerts already implemented. Priority focus areas are: 1) Complete Focus flags implementation for high-priority deals, 2) Fix integration with Deals module data layer, 3) Complete backend API endpoints for pipeline operations, 4) Execute pending database migrations for production deployment. The visual components and user interactions are working well, but backend data integration needs completion.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for pipeline state management, E2E tests for drag-and-drop functionality across devices, visual regression tests for alert styling, performance tests for large pipeline loads, integration tests for Deals module data flow

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Database Schema for 11 Pipeline Stages [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive database schema supporting 11 distinct pipeline stages with metadata tracking
### Details:
Design tables for pipeline_stages, stage_transitions, stage_timers, wip_limits, and focus_flags. Include fields for stage order, stage colors, alert thresholds (14/30 days), max WIP counts, and focus priority rankings. Create indexes for efficient querying of deals by stage and time-in-stage calculations.

## 2. Build Core MVC Pipeline Component Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Implement SuiteCRM MVC architecture for pipeline visualization module
### Details:
Create PipelineController for handling stage transitions and WIP validations. Build PipelineModel for data operations including stage queries and transition logging. Develop base PipelineView class with render methods for desktop and mobile layouts. Implement ViewPipeline extending SuiteCRM's SugarView for integration.

## 3. Implement Drag-and-Drop Engine with Touch Support [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create unified drag-and-drop system supporting mouse and touch interactions
### Details:

Implement visual drag preview, drop zone highlighting, and smooth animations. Add gesture detection for mobile pinch-to-zoom and swipe navigation. Include accessibility support with keyboard navigation.

## 4. Develop Stage Transition Logic and Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.3
### Description: Create business logic for valid stage transitions and enforcement rules
### Details:
Implement StageTransitionService with rules engine for allowed transitions (e.g., can't skip Due Diligence). Add WIP limit checking before allowing drops. Create transaction-safe transition recording with rollback capability. Build audit trail for all stage movements with timestamps and user tracking.
<info added on 2025-07-24T18:06:05.691Z>
Analysis complete of existing drag-and-drop implementation revealing system components include basic functionality with WIP limits, AJAX endpoints for stage updates, Focus flag integration, and state synchronization API. Current gaps identified: stage transition validation rules missing business logic enforcement, audit trail system requires enhancement for comprehensive tracking, time tracking alert mechanisms need implementation for stage duration monitoring. Next implementation phase should focus on StageTransitionService rules engine enhancement, business constraint validation layer, comprehensive audit logging with user attribution, and automated alert system for stage time thresholds.

<info added on 2025-07-24T18:15:17.997Z>
Found pipeline.js implementation with existing drag/drop functionality, focus reordering capabilities, WIP limit enforcement, and visual feedback systems. Current system provides basic stage movement but lacks comprehensive transition validation rules and enhanced audit trail capabilities. Implementation will extend existing AJAX endpoint structure with StageTransitionService layer to add business logic validation, prevent invalid stage skipping, and create detailed transition history with user attribution and timestamps.
