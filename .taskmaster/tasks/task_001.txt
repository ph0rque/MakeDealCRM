# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Unified Deal & Portfolio Pipeline Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the visual Kanban-style pipeline system with 11 stages covering acquisition to post-close management
# Details:
The pipeline UI is mostly complete with drag-and-drop functionality, time tracking, and visual alerts already implemented. Priority focus areas are: 1) Complete Focus flags implementation for high-priority deals, 2) Fix integration with Deals module data layer, 3) Complete backend API endpoints for pipeline operations, 4) Execute pending database migrations for production deployment. The visual components and user interactions are working well, but backend data integration needs completion.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for pipeline state management, E2E tests for drag-and-drop functionality across devices, visual regression tests for alert styling, performance tests for large pipeline loads, integration tests for Deals module data flow

## 7. Implement WIP Limit Enforcement System [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Build work-in-progress limit management with visual indicators
### Details:
Create WIPLimitManager validating drops against configured limits per stage. Build visual capacity indicators showing current/max deals per stage. Implement overflow handling with user prompts for limit overrides. Add administrative interface for setting and adjusting WIP limits. Create reporting for WIP limit violations.

## 8. Complete Focus Flag Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.7
### Description: Finish priority flagging system for high-focus deals within stages
### Details:
Complete the FocusFlag entity implementation with stage-specific priority rankings. Finish building visual star/pin indicators for focused deals. Complete drag-to-reorder functionality within focus items. Add quick-toggle actions for focus flag assignment. Implement focus filter views showing only flagged deals across pipeline. This is a critical missing piece that needs immediate completion.

## 9. Build Responsive Design System for Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.6
### Description: Create adaptive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile views
### Details:
Implement responsive grid system with collapsible stages for mobile. Create horizontal scrolling with stage locking for tablet view. Build card size variations (compact/normal/expanded) based on viewport. Add touch-optimized controls with larger hit targets. Implement progressive disclosure for deal details on smaller screens.

## 10. Implement State Management Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.8
### Description: Create centralized state management for pipeline data and UI state
### Details:
Build PipelineStore using Redux/Vuex pattern for state management. Implement optimistic updates for drag operations with rollback on failure. Create state persistence layer for user preferences (view mode, filters, sort order). Add real-time synchronization for multi-user environments. Build undo/redo functionality for stage transitions.

## 11. Optimize Performance for Large Datasets [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.10
### Description: Implement performance optimizations for pipelines with 1000+ deals

### Description: Repair broken integration between pipeline UI and SuiteCRM Deals module
### Details:
Debug and fix the data layer connection between the pipeline visualization and the existing SuiteCRM Deals module. Ensure proper field mapping, relationship handling, and data synchronization.

## 16. Configure Deals module to default to pipeline view [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the Deals module navigation to redirect to the Kanban pipeline view (index.php?module=Deals&action=pipeline#) instead of the default list view (ajaxui#ajaxUILoc=index.php%3Fmodule%3DDeals%26action%3Dindex). This involves updating menu links, module routing, and any references in the codebase that direct users to the Deals module.
