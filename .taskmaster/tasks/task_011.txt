# Title: Fix Deals Module Foundation and SuiteCRM Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement general fixes and improvements for the Deals module including SuiteCRM integration, security enhancements, UI consistency, performance optimizations, and various bug fixes to establish a stable foundation.
# Details:
Implement comprehensive fixes and improvements across the Deals module: 1) Convert existing standalone code to proper SuiteCRM extension architecture with manifest.php and module loader entries. 2) Execute database migrations for custom tables (deals, deal_stages, deal_contacts_relationships) and add required custom fields. 3) Fix security vulnerabilities by implementing prepared statements, proper input sanitization using SuiteCRM's security classes, and XSS protection through output encoding. 4) Ensure UI consistency with SuiteCRM core themes using proper CSS framework and template structure. 5) Address performance issues including query optimization, caching implementation, and memory usage improvements. 6) Fix module loader entries in ModuleBuilder format and ensure proper language file loading. 7) Resolve any JavaScript errors and compatibility issues. 8) Implement proper error handling and logging throughout the module. 9) Fix menu items using SuiteCRM's menu system and ensure proper ACL integration. 10) Address any workflow engine and reporting system integration issues. 11) Fix any broken CRUD operations, search functionality, or data validation issues.

# Test Strategy:
Verify proper module installation through SuiteCRM admin interface and module loader. Test database schema creation and field additions through direct database inspection. Validate security fixes using automated security scanning tools and manual penetration testing. Test UI consistency across different SuiteCRM themes and browser compatibility. Perform comprehensive functional testing of all CRUD operations, search, filtering, and reporting features. Test performance improvements with load testing and memory profiling. Validate JavaScript functionality and error handling across different browsers. Test language file loading and menu item functionality. Verify integration with existing SuiteCRM modules like Contacts and Accounts. Perform regression testing to ensure no existing functionality is broken. Test upgrade/downgrade scenarios to ensure module stability.

Handle data type conversions and constraints properly.

## 3. Implement Security Enhancements [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Fix security vulnerabilities by implementing prepared statements, proper input sanitization using SuiteCRM's security classes, and XSS protection through output encoding.
### Details:
Replace all direct SQL queries with SuiteCRM's DBManager prepared statements. Implement input sanitization using SugarCleaner and SugarSecurity classes. Add XSS protection through proper output encoding in templates. Implement CSRF protection for forms. Add proper ACL checks throughout the module using ACLController. Sanitize all user inputs in controllers and API endpoints. Use SuiteCRM's security framework for authentication and authorization.

## 4. Ensure UI Consistency and Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.3
### Description: Address UI consistency with SuiteCRM core themes and implement performance optimizations including query optimization, caching, and memory usage improvements.
### Details:
Update all templates to use SuiteCRM's Smarty template system and CSS framework. Implement proper theme integration with SuiteCRM's theme engine. Optimize database queries using proper indexing and query structure. Implement SuiteCRM's caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data. Reduce memory footprint by optimizing object instantiation and data loading. Fix JavaScript compatibility issues and minimize asset loading. Ensure responsive design compatibility.

## 5. Fix CRUD Operations and Integration Issues [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3, 11.4

Fix all Create, Read, Update, Delete operations using proper SuiteCRM patterns. Implement search functionality using SuiteCRM's search framework. Add comprehensive data validation using SuiteCRM's validation classes. Fix menu items integration through proper menu system configuration. Implement workflow engine hooks for automated processes. Ensure reporting system compatibility with proper metadata. Add comprehensive error handling and logging using SuiteCRM's logging framework. Fix any remaining JavaScript errors and API endpoints.

## 6. Fix Deals Module Pipeline View Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.11
### Description: Fix 500 error when accessing Deals module index page and ensure pipeline/kanban view loads as the default view with proper AJAX functionality.
### Details:
Investigate and resolve the 500 error occurring when accessing the Deals module index page. Key areas to address: 1) Fix redirect logic in view.list.php to properly handle pipeline view routing, 2) Ensure pipeline action is properly registered in the module's controller and action mapping, 3) Verify AJAX endpoints are correctly configured and accessible for pipeline data loading, 4) Debug and fix any PHP errors in the pipeline view initialization code, 5) Ensure proper SuiteCRM module structure is followed for view registration, 6) Validate that all required JavaScript and CSS assets are properly loaded for the pipeline interface, 7) Test AJAX response handling and error reporting for better debugging, 8) Verify database connections and queries used by the pipeline view are functioning correctly.
