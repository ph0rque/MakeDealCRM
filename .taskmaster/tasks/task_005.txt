# Task ID: 5
# Title: Enhance Email Integration and Auto-Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Improve the existing email parsing system with advanced deal matching and contact extraction
# Details:
Enhance existing email parsing logic hooks for deals@mycrm forwarding. Improve duplicate detection with advanced fuzzy matching algorithms. Implement automatic contact extraction and linking from email signatures and content. Add attachment processing and storage. Enhance deal creation/updating logic with better context recognition. Implement email thread tracking and conversation history linking.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for email parsing logic, integration tests for duplicate detection accuracy, E2E tests for full email-to-deal workflow, attachment processing tests, performance tests for large email volumes

# Subtasks:
## 1. Email parsing algorithm improvements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Enhance existing email parsing logic to better extract structured data from various email formats and improve accuracy
### Details:
Upgrade current email parsing system to handle HTML, plain text, and rich text formats. Implement better header extraction, signature detection, and content sanitization. Add support for international character sets and encoding formats.

## 2. Fuzzy matching implementation for duplicates [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement advanced fuzzy matching algorithms to detect and prevent duplicate deal creation from similar emails
### Details:
Create fuzzy matching system using string similarity algorithms (Levenshtein distance, Jaro-Winkler) to compare email subjects, sender information, and content. Implement confidence scoring and threshold-based duplicate detection.

## 3. Contact extraction using NLP/regex patterns [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop intelligent contact extraction system using natural language processing and regex patterns to identify contacts from email content
### Details:
Implement NLP-based entity recognition for names, companies, phone numbers, and addresses. Create regex patterns for common contact information formats. Add signature parsing to automatically extract contact details from email signatures.

## 4. Attachment processing pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Build robust attachment processing system to handle, store, and extract data from email attachments
### Details:
Create attachment processing pipeline supporting PDF, DOC, images, and other common formats. Implement virus scanning, file size limits, and secure storage. Add metadata extraction and thumbnail generation for supported file types.

## 5. Deal context recognition engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Develop intelligent system to recognize deal-related context from email content and automatically categorize or link to existing deals
### Details:
Create context analysis engine using keyword matching, sentiment analysis, and pattern recognition to identify deal stages, urgency levels, and relevant deal types. Implement automatic deal categorization and linking logic.

## 6. Email thread tracking system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement comprehensive email thread tracking to maintain conversation continuity and relationship mapping
### Details:
Build email thread tracking using Message-ID headers, In-Reply-To fields, and subject line analysis. Create thread grouping logic and conversation flow visualization. Implement participant tracking across thread lifecycles.

## 7. Conversation history data model [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.6
### Description: Design and implement data model for storing and organizing email conversation history with efficient querying capabilities
### Details:
Create database schema for conversation history with optimized indexing for fast retrieval. Implement data retention policies and archiving strategies. Design API endpoints for conversation history access and management.

## 8. Error handling and retry mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms for robust email processing pipeline
### Details:
Create error handling framework with categorized error types, logging, and alerting. Implement exponential backoff retry mechanisms for transient failures. Add dead letter queue for permanently failed emails and manual review process.

## 9. Performance optimization for bulk email processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8
### Description: Optimize system performance for handling large volumes of emails with parallel processing and efficient resource utilization
### Details:
Implement parallel email processing using queue systems and worker processes. Add caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data. Optimize database queries and implement connection pooling. Add monitoring and metrics collection for performance tracking.
