# Product Requirements Document: MakeDealCRM

## Executive Summary
MakeDealCRM is a specialized CRM system designed specifically for solo dealmakers (business buyers, micro-PE investors, search fund principals). The system streamlines the entire acquisition lifecycle from sourcing through post-acquisition management, replacing traditional CRM modules with a deal-centric architecture.

## Core Principle
The CRM is built around the concept of "Deal" as the central object, consolidating all related information and workflows in one place. The system must be intuitive enough for a single operator to manage multiple deals efficiently without administrative overhead.

## Key Features

### 1. The "Deal" as Central Object [COMPLETED]

**Requirements:**
- Auto-capture deals from multiple sources (email forwarding, CSV import, web forms, Chrome extension)
- Duplicate prevention with intelligent matching and warnings
- Centralized relationships: Contacts, Documents, Tasks, Financials, and Checklist items
- Email integration with automatic deal creation/updating via forwarded emails to deals@mycrm

**Technical Implementation Completed:**
- Custom Bean architecture with 26 fields including financial metrics
- Real-time duplicate detection with fuzzy matching

## User Stories

1. **Deal Capture**: As a solo dealmaker, I want to forward emails to deals@mycrm and have the system automatically create or update deals with all related contacts and attachments, so I maintain a single source of truth without manual data entry.

2. **Pipeline Management**: As a busy investor, I want to see at-risk deals highlighted in my pipeline view on both desktop and mobile, so I can prioritize my efforts and prevent opportunities from stalling.

3. **Due Diligence**: As a solo buyer, I want to apply standardized checklists that auto-generate tasks with reminders and file requests, so nothing falls through the cracks during critical evaluation periods.

4. **Stakeholder Communication**: As the sole point of contact, I want quick access to all deal stakeholders with last-contact indicators and pre-filled templates, so I can maintain relationships efficiently.

5. **Financial Analysis**: As an investor working alone, I want to sort deals by financial metrics and run what-if scenarios including capital stack feasibility, so I can focus on the most promising opportunities.

6. **Easy Deployment**: As a non-technical user, I want to deploy the CRM on AWS with minimal configuration and automatic backups, so I can focus on deals rather than IT management.

## Success Metrics

- Deal capture time reduced by 80% through automation
- Zero missed follow-ups due to visual pipeline alerts
- 100% checklist completion rate before deal closure
- 50% reduction in time spent on stakeholder communication
- Single-screen access to all critical financial metrics
- Deployment completed in under 30 minutes

## Constraints and Assumptions

- Single-user focus (no complex multi-user workflows initially)
- AWS as primary deployment platform
- SuiteCRM as underlying framework
- Mobile-responsive but not native mobile apps
- English language interface initially

## Future Considerations

- Multi-user support with team collaboration features
- Native mobile applications
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with third-party data providers
- AI-powered deal scoring and recommendations
