# Email Processing Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the refactoring of email processing logic in the Deals module. All email-related functionality has been consolidated into a single, centralized service class.

## New Architecture

### EmailProcessorService Class
**Location**: `/custom/modules/Deals/services/EmailProcessorService.php`

This singleton service class now handles all email processing operations:

1. **Email Parsing**
   - Extracts deal information from incoming emails
   - Identifies contacts and their roles
   - Processes attachments
   - Performs duplicate detection

2. **Thread Tracking**
   - Tracks email conversations related to deals
   - Links related emails together
   - Maintains conversation history

3. **Email Sending**
   - Sends file request emails
   - Handles notification emails
   - Manages email templates

4. **Template Management**
   - Centralized template storage
   - Dynamic variable replacement
   - Support for multiple template types

## Refactored Components

### 1. DealsEmailLogicHook
**File**: `/custom/modules/Deals/DealsEmailLogicHook.php`
- Updated to use `EmailProcessorService::getInstance()`
- Removed direct email processing logic
- Simplified notification handling

### 2. FileRequestApi
**File**: `/custom/modules/Deals/api/FileRequestApi.php`
- Removed email template methods
- Updated to use `EmailProcessorService` for sending emails
- Cleaned up unnecessary email-related code

### 3. Deprecated Files
The following files are now superseded by EmailProcessorService:
- `EmailProcessor.php` - Functionality moved to EmailProcessorService
- `EmailParser.php` - Parsing logic integrated into EmailProcessorService
- `EmailThreadTracker.php` - Thread tracking integrated into EmailProcessorService
- `FileRequestEmailTemplates.php` - Template management integrated into EmailProcessorService

## Key Features

### 1. Singleton Pattern
```php
$emailProcessor = EmailProcessorService::getInstance();
```

### 2. Comprehensive Email Processing
```php
$result = $emailProcessor->processIncomingEmail($email);
```

### 3. File Request Email Sending
```php
$result = $emailProcessor->sendFileRequestEmail($requestData, $deal, $templateType);
```

### 4. Notification System
```php
$result = $emailProcessor->sendNotification($type, $data);
```

### 5. Thread Management
```php
$conversations = $emailProcessor->getDealConversations($dealId);
$summary = $emailProcessor->getThreadSummary($threadId);
```

## Database Tables Created

1. **email_thread_deals**
   - Tracks email threads and their relationship to deals
   - Stores message IDs for thread continuity

2. **email_processing_log**
   - Logs all email processing attempts
   - Tracks success/failure and processing metrics

## Configuration

Email processing is configured through:
- `/custom/modules/Deals/config/email_config.php`

Key configuration options:
- Monitor email address
- Processing retry attempts
- Duplicate detection settings
- Contact extraction options
- Notification preferences

## Testing

A test script is available at:
- `/custom/modules/Deals/test_email_processor_service.php`

This script verifies:
- Email parsing functionality
- File request email preparation
- Thread tracking
- Notification system

## Best Practices

1. **Always use the singleton instance**
   ```php
   $emailProcessor = EmailProcessorService::getInstance();
   ```

2. **Handle errors appropriately**
   ```php
   if (!$result['success']) {
       // Handle error
       $this->log->error($result['message']);
   }
   ```

3. **Use configuration for customization**
   - Modify email_config.php for behavior changes
   - Don't hardcode email addresses or settings

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Centralized Logic**
   - All email processing in one place
   - Easier to maintain and debug

2. **Reusability**
   - Single service can be used across different modules
   - Consistent behavior throughout the application

3. **Better Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive logging
   - Processing history tracking
   - Retry logic built-in

4. **Improved Testing**
   - Easier to unit test
   - Mock-friendly design

5. **Performance**
   - Caching for templates and threads
   - Batch processing capabilities
   - Optimized database queries

## Migration Notes

When updating existing code:
1. Replace `new DealsEmailProcessor()` with `EmailProcessorService::getInstance()`
2. Update method calls to match new interface
3. Remove any direct email sending code
4. Use the service for all email-related operations

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Add support for more email template types
2. Implement email queue for better performance
3. Add webhook support for real-time processing
4. Enhanced duplicate detection algorithms
5. Machine learning for better parsing accuracy
