/**
 * Pipeline Stage Hook Class - Stage Transition Management and History
 * 
 * This class is responsible for tracking and managing pipeline stage transitions
 * throughout the deal lifecycle. It provides critical functionality for:
 * 
 * - Recording all stage transitions with timestamps and user information
 * - Calculating time spent in each stage for analytics
 * - Sending notifications for significant stage changes
 * - Maintaining metrics for pipeline velocity reporting
 * 
 * Pipeline stages represent the deal's progress from initial sourcing through
 * to closing. Accurate tracking of stage transitions is essential for:
 * - Sales forecasting and pipeline analysis
 * - Identifying bottlenecks in the deal process
 * - Team performance measurement
 * - Compliance and audit requirements

     * Update stage history after deal save
     * 
     * Records pipeline stage transitions in a dedicated history table for
     * comprehensive tracking and analysis. This method is triggered after
     * every deal save to detect and record stage changes.
     * 
     * Functionality:
     * 1. Detects stage changes by comparing old and new values
     * 2. Creates immutable history records with:
     *    - Timestamp of transition
     *    - User who made the change
     *    - Old and new stage values
     *    - Optional transition notes
     * 
     * 3. Updates stage metrics:
     *    - Time spent in previous stage
     *    - Stage velocity calculations
     *    - Conversion funnel metrics
     * 
     * 4. Triggers notifications for configured transitions
     * 
     * The history data enables:
     * - Pipeline velocity reports
     * - Stage duration analysis
     * - User activity tracking
     * - Process optimization insights
