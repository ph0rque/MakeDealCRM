# Claude Code Configuration for Claude Flow

## 🚨 CRITICAL: PARALLEL EXECUTION AFTER SWARM INIT

**MANDATORY RULE**: Once swarm is initialized with memory, ALL subsequent operations MUST be parallel:

1. **TodoWrite** → Always batch 5-10+ todos in ONE call
2. **Task spawning** → Spawn ALL agents in ONE message
3. **File operations** → Batch ALL reads/writes together
4. **NEVER** operate sequentially after swarm init

## 🚨 CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION FOR ALL ACTIONS

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: ALL operations MUST be concurrent/parallel in a single message:

### 🔴 MANDATORY CONCURRENT PATTERNS:

1. **TodoWrite**: ALWAYS batch ALL todos in ONE call (5-10+ todos minimum)
2. **Task tool**: ALWAYS spawn ALL agents in ONE message with full instructions
3. **File operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL reads/writes/edits in ONE message
4. **Bash commands**: ALWAYS batch ALL terminal operations in ONE message
5. **Memory operations**: ALWAYS batch ALL memory store/retrieve in ONE message

### ⚡ GOLDEN RULE: "1 MESSAGE = ALL RELATED OPERATIONS"

**Examples of CORRECT concurrent execution:**

```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT: Everything in ONE message
[Single Message]:
  - TodoWrite { todos: [10+ todos with all statuses/priorities] }
  - Task("Agent 1 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 2 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Task("Agent 3 with full instructions and hooks")
  - Read("file1.js")
  - Read("file2.js")
  - Read("file3.js")
  - Write("output1.js", content)
  - Write("output2.js", content)
  - Bash("npm install")
  - Bash("npm test")
  - Bash("npm run build")
```

**Examples of WRONG sequential execution:**

```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: Multiple messages (NEVER DO THIS)
Message 1: TodoWrite { todos: [single todo] }
Message 2: Task("Agent 1")
Message 3: Task("Agent 2")
Message 4: Read("file1.js")
Message 5: Write("output1.js")
Message 6: Bash("npm install")
// This is 6x slower and breaks coordination!
```

### 🎯 CONCURRENT EXECUTION CHECKLIST:

Before sending ANY message, ask yourself:

- ✅ Are ALL related TodoWrite operations batched together?
- ✅ Are ALL Task spawning operations in ONE message?
- ✅ Are ALL file operations (Read/Write/Edit) batched together?
- ✅ Are ALL bash commands grouped in ONE message?
- ✅ Are ALL memory operations concurrent?

If ANY answer is "No", you MUST combine operations into a single message!

## 🚀 CRITICAL: Claude Code Does ALL Real Work

### 🎯 CLAUDE CODE IS THE ONLY EXECUTOR

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Claude Code performs ALL actual work:

### ✅ Claude Code ALWAYS Handles:

- 🔧 **ALL file operations** (Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, Glob, Grep)
- 💻 **ALL code generation** and programming tasks
- 🖥️ **ALL bash commands** and system operations
- 🏗️ **ALL actual implementation** work
- 🔍 **ALL project navigation** and code analysis
- 📝 **ALL TodoWrite** and task management
- 🔄 **ALL git operations** (commit, push, merge)
- 📦 **ALL package management** (npm, pip, etc.)
- 🧪 **ALL testing** and validation
- 🔧 **ALL debugging** and troubleshooting

### 🧠 Claude Flow MCP Tools ONLY Handle:

- 🎯 **Coordination only** - Planning Claude Code's actions
- 💾 **Memory management** - Storing decisions and context
- 🤖 **Neural features** - Learning from Claude Code's work
- 📊 **Performance tracking** - Monitoring Claude Code's efficiency
- 🐝 **Swarm orchestration** - Coordinating multiple Claude Code instances
- 🔗 **GitHub integration** - Advanced repository coordination

## 🌟 Docker Development Context

- **This app is running in docker.**

## 🚧 Development Testing Configuration

- Use http://localhost:8080/ for the root URL when testing and running playwright.

## Introspection

- **Please ask questions and confirm assumptions before generating code.**
