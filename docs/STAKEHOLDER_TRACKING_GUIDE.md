## Advanced Features

### API Integration

The module provides REST API endpoints for integration:

```
GET /rest/v10/Contacts/stakeholder/roles
GET /rest/v10/Contacts/stakeholder/by-role/{role}
GET /rest/v10/Deals/{id}/stakeholders
POST /rest/v10/Deals/{id}/stakeholders
PUT /rest/v10/Deals/{id}/stakeholders/{contact_id}
DELETE /rest/v10/Deals/{id}/stakeholders/{contact_id}
```

### Custom Development

Extend the module by:
- Adding custom roles in `ContactRoleManager.php`
- Creating new email templates
- Building custom reports
- Adding workflow automation

## Security Considerations

- Role assignments require Contact edit permissions
- Bulk operations require admin or group permissions
- Communication history respects record-level security
- Email templates sanitize user input

## Performance Tips

- Use indexed searches for large datasets
- Enable caching for stakeholder queries
- Limit bulk operations to 50 records
- Schedule maintenance jobs during off-hours
