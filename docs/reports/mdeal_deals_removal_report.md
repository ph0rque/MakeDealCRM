## Remaining References to Update

### 1. Related Modules Still Using mdeal_Deals:
These modules still contain references that need to be addressed:

#### mdeal_Leads Module:
- `/custom/modules/mdeal_Leads/metadata/detailviewdefs.php` - View converted deal button
- `/custom/modules/mdeal_Leads/mdeal_Leads.php` - Deal creation logic
- Multiple references to `mdeal_Deals` class and module

#### mdeal_Accounts Module:
- `/custom/modules/mdeal_Accounts/metadata/subpaneldefs.php` - Deals subpanel configuration
- `/custom/modules/mdeal_Accounts/mdeal_Accounts.php` - Deal counting queries
- `/custom/modules/mdeal_Accounts/AccountLogicHooks.php` - Deal relationship logic

#### mdeal_Contacts Module:
- `/custom/modules/mdeal_Contacts/ContactLogicHooks.php` - Deal relationship hooks
- `/custom/modules/mdeal_Contacts/metadata/subpaneldefs.php` - Deals subpanel

### 2. Database Tables to Update:
The following SQL scripts reference mdeal_deals tables:
- `/custom/modules/Pipelines/install/pipeline_tables.sql`
- Multiple stored procedures and views reference `mdeal_deals` table

### 3. Test Files:
Many test files still reference mdeal_Deals and need updating:
- Integration tests in `/tests/integration/`
- Unit tests in `/tests/unit/`
- E2E tests in `/SuiteCRM/tests/e2e/`

### 4. Pipeline Module Database References:
Multiple files in the Pipelines module contain hardcoded references to mdeal_* tables:
- `PipelineMaintenanceJob.php`
- `PipelineAutomationEngine.php`
- `StageValidationManager.php`
- `PerformanceOptimizer.php`

## Recommendations

1. **Database Migration**: Create a migration script to:
   - Rename `mdeal_deals` table to `deals` (if not already exists)
   - Update all foreign key references
   - Update all views and stored procedures

2. **Module Dependencies**: The mdeal_Leads, mdeal_Accounts, and mdeal_Contacts modules should be evaluated:
   - Consider if they should also be migrated to standard modules
   - Or update their references to use the standard Deals module

3. **Testing**: After all updates:
   - Run all unit tests
   - Run integration tests
   - Perform manual testing of pipeline functionality
   - Test lead conversion process
   - Verify all subpanel relationships

4. **Code Review**: Review all remaining mdeal_* modules to ensure consistency with the new architecture.

## Potential Issues

1. **Database Compatibility**: The current code assumes `mdeal_deals` table exists. Need to ensure proper table naming.
2. **Class References**: Some PHP files may use `mdeal_Deals` class name which needs to be updated to `Deals`.
3. **Relationship Definitions**: Module relationships may need to be redefined in vardefs.
4. **ACL Permissions**: User permissions may need to be updated for the new module name.

## Next Steps

1. Update all remaining module references
2. Create and run database migration scripts
3. Update test files
4. Test thoroughly in development environment
5. Update deployment scripts if needed
