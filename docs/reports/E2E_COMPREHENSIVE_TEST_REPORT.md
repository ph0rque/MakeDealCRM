## Conclusion

While the MakeDealCRM application core functionality appears stable, the refactoring has introduced significant compatibility issues with the test suite and some user interface inconsistencies. The main blocker is the missing "Create Deals" navigation option, which prevents comprehensive testing of the core functionality.

**Immediate focus should be on:**
1. Restoring deal creation navigation
2. Updating test selectors
3. Fixing test infrastructure security issues

Once these critical issues are resolved, the comprehensive test suite will provide excellent coverage for all PRD requirements including:
- Personal Due-Diligence Checklists
- Simplified Stakeholder Tracking  
- At-a-Glance Financial & Valuation Hub
- Email-to-Deal creation and updates
- Pipeline drag-and-drop functionality

**Overall Testing Status:** üî¥ **BLOCKED** - Critical issues must be resolved before comprehensive testing can proceed.

**Next Steps:**
1. Development team to address BUG-001 (Missing Create Deals navigation)
2. QA team to update test selectors once UI is stable
3. DevOps team to review test environment security configurations
4. Re-run comprehensive test suite after fixes are implemented

**Estimated Resolution Time:** 2-3 days for critical fixes, 1 week for complete test suite stability.
