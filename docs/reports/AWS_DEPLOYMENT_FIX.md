# AWS Deployment Wizard Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **URL Display Issue**: The wizard shows "https://AWS Default" instead of the actual EC2 URL
2. **Connection Refused Error**: The EC2 instance refuses connections on the provided URL

## Fixes Applied

### 1. CloudFormation Template Updates
- Modified the UserData script to use HTTP initially instead of HTTPS (until SSL is configured)
- Added proper region parameter to AWS CLI commands
- Added database readiness check before starting the application
- Added deployment logging for debugging

### 2. Deployment Wizard JavaScript Updates
- Fixed URL generation to properly handle IP addresses
- Added console logging for debugging deployment info
- Improved URL formatting when no protocol is specified

### 3. Created Troubleshooting Script
- Created `/SuiteCRM/aws-deploy/scripts/troubleshoot-deployment.sh`
- Use it to diagnose deployment issues: `./troubleshoot-deployment.sh <instance-id-or-ip>`

## Root Causes

1. **HTTPS Redirect Issue**: The application was configured to use HTTPS immediately, but SSL certificates take time to provision
2. **Timing Issue**: The application might not be fully started when the wizard completes
3. **URL Format**: The deployment info wasn't properly formatting the EC2 URL

## Next Steps

1. **Re-deploy** using the updated templates
2. **Use HTTP first**: Access the application via `http://ec2-35-169-23-176.compute-1.amazonaws.com` (not HTTPS)
3. **Check Instance Health**: Run the troubleshooting script:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/andrewgauntlet/Desktop/MakeDealCRM/SuiteCRM/aws-deploy/scripts
   ./troubleshoot-deployment.sh 35.169.23.176
   ```

4. **SSH into the instance** to check if Docker is running:
   ```bash
   ssh -i <your-key.pem> ec2-user@35.169.23.176
   sudo docker ps
   sudo docker logs makedealcrm-app
   ```

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Wait Time**: After deployment completes, wait 3-5 minutes for the application to fully start
2. **Security Groups**: Ensure your IP is allowed if you've restricted SSH access
3. **CloudWatch Logs**: Check AWS CloudWatch for any deployment errors

## Testing the Fix

To test if the instance is actually running:
```bash
# Test HTTP
curl -I http://ec2-35-169-23-176.compute-1.amazonaws.com

# Test HTTPS (might fail initially)
curl -I -k https://ec2-35-169-23-176.compute-1.amazonaws.com
```

If both fail, the issue is likely:
- Docker containers not started
- Application failed to deploy
- Network/firewall issues
