### Low Priority
1. **Consider removing sample deals** in production
2. **Add automated E2E tests** to CI/CD pipeline

## Test Artifacts

- **Screenshots:** Available in `/test-results/` directory
- **Test Logs:** Detailed console output captured
- **Report Images:** 
  - `pipeline-test-report-*.png`
  - `pipeline-fixes-verification-report.png`

## Conclusion

The pipeline functionality is working correctly with all critical fixes implemented:
- ✅ **No "missing required params" error** - Pipeline loads successfully
- ✅ **Drag-and-drop fully functional** - Deal cards have draggable=true, 9 drop zones available
