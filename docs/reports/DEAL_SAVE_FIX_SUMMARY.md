# Deal Save 500 Error Fix Summary

## Issue
When submitting a new deal form, users were getting a 500 error. The browser console showed LastPass extension errors (which can be ignored).

## Root Causes Identified and Fixed

### 1. Database Configuration
- The `opportunities_cstm` table already exists with custom fields
- The Deal bean was missing `custom_fields = true` property
- **Fixed**: Updated Deal.php to enable custom fields support

### 2. Detail View Error
- The custom detail view was trying to extend `OpportunitiesViewDetail` which doesn't exist
- This caused a fatal error when redirecting after save
- **Fixed**: Changed to extend `ViewDetail` directly

### 3. ACL Access Permission
- The "access" ACL permission was set to 89 instead of 90
- **Fixed**: Updated all ACL permissions to 90 for consistency

## What Works Now

1. **Deal Creation**: You can create deals through the EditView form
2. **Deal Saving**: Deals save successfully to the database
3. **Custom Fields**: Custom fields like `pipeline_stage_c` are saved properly
4. **Detail View**: After saving, users are redirected to a working detail view
5. **Pipeline Integration**: Pipeline stage is properly set when creating from pipeline

## Test the Fix

### Option 1: Use Test Page
Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/test_deal_save.php
- This page allows you to test deal saving with a simple form
- Shows system status and verification

### Option 2: Use Regular Create Form
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/index.php?module=Deals&action=EditView
2. Fill in the required fields:
   - Deal Name
   - Expected Close Date
   - Sales Stage
   - Amount (optional)
3. Click Save

### Option 3: Test from Pipeline
1. Go to: http://localhost:8080/index.php?module=Deals&action=Pipeline
2. Click "Add Deal" at the bottom of any column
3. The form should open with the correct pipeline stage pre-selected

## If Issues Persist

1. **Clear all caches**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec suitecrm sh -c "rm -rf cache/* && chmod -R 777 cache"
   ```

2. **Run repair script**:
   Navigate to: http://localhost:8080/repair_deals_module.php

3. **Check error logs**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose logs suitecrm --tail 100 | grep -i error
   ```

## Technical Details

- **Module**: Deals
- **Base Table**: opportunities
- **Custom Table**: opportunities_cstm  
- **Bean Class**: Deal (extends SugarBean)
- **Custom Fields**: Enabled via `$custom_fields = true`

The deal save functionality should now work without any 500 errors!
