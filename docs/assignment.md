# **Enterprise Legacy Modernization Project**

## **Introduction**

When you enter the professional software development world, you won't be building applications from scratch on greenfield projects. Instead, you'll inherit massive, complex legacy codebases that have been "duct taped together" over decades—systems with millions of lines of code written in older versions of Java, COBOL, Python, or C that somehow keep entire businesses running.

These enterprise systems represent the reality of software development: proven business logic wrapped in outdated technology stacks, sprawling architectures that evolved organically, and critical functionality buried in code that nobody fully understands anymore. Your ability to quickly comprehend these systems and modernize them effectively will determine your career trajectory.

This project simulates that exact scenario. You'll take a real open-source codebase with over 1,000,000 lines of legacy code and use AI-assisted development tools—like Cursor and Claude Code—to not just understand it, but to completely modernize and relaunch it for a new target market.

The skills you develop here translate directly to enterprise value: companies desperately need developers who can leverage AI to breathe new life into their legacy systems while preserving the valuable business logic that took years to perfect. This isn't about replacing legacy systems—it's about evolving them.

## **Core Challenge**

Select a large-scale legacy open-source codebase (1M+ lines), identify a specific target user segment that could benefit from a modernized version, then use AI-assisted development to create a completely relaunch-ready application that preserves the core business logic while delivering a modern user experience and architecture.

**Success means:** Shipping a working, modernized application that demonstrates both deep understanding of the legacy system and the ability to transform complex codebases using AI assistance.

## **Project Pathways**

Choose one pathway based on the type of legacy modernization challenge you want to tackle:

### **Path 1: Enterprise CRM Modernization**

**Legacy Codebase**: SugarCRM CE (2.3M lines, PHP 7.4) or SuiteCRM (1.8M lines, PHP)   
**Why These Systems**: Contain sophisticated customer relationship management business logic with complex workflows, custom field systems, and integration patterns that took years to refine 

**Modernization Opportunities**:

* Mobile-first architecture for field sales teams  
* Industry-specific customizations (healthcare, real estate, manufacturing)  
* Modern API-first design with microservices architecture  
* AI-powered lead scoring and customer insights

### **Path 2: Office Suite Platform Transformation**

**Legacy Codebase**: Apache OpenOffice (8M+ lines, C++) or LibreOffice (10M+ lines, C++)

## **Target User Selection**

After choosing your pathway, identify a specific target user segment that represents a modernization opportunity:

**Examples of Target Users:**

1. **SugarCRM → Real Estate CRM**: Agents who need mobile-first property management with modern UX

3. **Trac → Startup Project Management**: Small tech teams wanting simple, fast issue tracking without enterprise complexity  
4. **Alfresco → Small Business Workflow**: SMBs needing document approval workflows without enterprise overhead

**Target User Requirements:**

* Must represent a legitimate market opportunity that could benefit from the legacy system's core functionality  
* Should highlight specific pain points that modern technology can solve  
* Needs to be narrow enough to complete in 7 days but broad enough to demonstrate meaningful modernization
