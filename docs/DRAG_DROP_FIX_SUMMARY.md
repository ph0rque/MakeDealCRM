# Drag-and-Drop Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **JavaScript Syntax Errors**
   - The error shown in the screenshot was due to the deals list view trying to query a non-existent `deals` table
   - Fixed by updating queries to use the correct `opportunities` table

2. **Simplified List Views**
   - Removed complex custom functionality that could break the view
   - Both `/modules/Deals/views/view.list.php` and `/custom/modules/Deals/views/view.list.php` now extend the base Opportunities list view

3. **Pipeline View Implementation**
   - Created a complete pipeline view at `/custom/modules/Deals/views/view.pipeline.php`
   - This view properly loads deals data and renders the pipeline using Smarty templates
   - Includes all necessary data for drag-and-drop functionality

4. **Supporting Files Created**
   - `/custom/modules/Deals/tpls/pipeline.tpl` - Smarty template for pipeline HTML structure
   - `/custom/modules/Deals/tpls/deals.css` - Complete CSS styling including drag-and-drop states
   - `/custom/modules/Deals/js/pipeline.js` - Already existed with full drag-and-drop functionality

## How Drag-and-Drop Works

1. **HTML Structure**
   - Deal cards have `draggable="true"` attribute and class `draggable`
   - Pipeline stages have class `droppable` to receive dropped cards

2. **JavaScript Events**
   - `pipeline.js` attaches event handlers for:
     - `dragstart` - When user starts dragging a card
     - `dragover` - When card is dragged over a drop zone
     - `drop` - When card is dropped
     - `dragend` - Cleanup after drag operation

3. **AJAX Updates**
   - When a card is dropped, an AJAX call is made to `index.php?module=Deals&action=updatePipelineStage`
   - The controller's `action_updatePipelineStage` method handles the database update

4. **Visual Feedback**
   - Cards show opacity change when being dragged
   - Drop zones highlight when a card is dragged over them
   - WIP limit warnings show if a stage is full

## Testing Instructions

1. Navigate to the Deals module
2. Click on "Pipeline" in the menu (or go to `index.php?module=Deals&action=pipeline`)
3. You should see the pipeline view with deal cards in columns
4. Try dragging a deal card from one stage to another
5. The card should move and the change should be saved automatically

## Important Notes

- The fix ensures compatibility with legacy JavaScript (no arrow functions, template literals, etc.)
- All database queries now use the correct `opportunities` table
- The implementation follows SuiteCRM's MVC pattern
- Error handling is included for missing files or failed operations
